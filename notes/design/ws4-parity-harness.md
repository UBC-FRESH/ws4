# The parity harness: what WS4 is compared against, and what it found

The project claims WS4 works as a replacement for the established implementation. This note records
what the comparison is, so a reader can judge it, and what it found.

## What is compared, and why that

The reference sample ships **its own outputs** for the road model: `cost_destination.<mill>.csv` holds
`NODE,SUM_HAUL` — the sum of the segment haul rates from that network node to that mill, and `-1` where
it can reach no such route. That is the same quantity WS4's route model computes, from the same tables,
so comparing them tests the **routing** rather than the data: WS4 loads the reference's segments,
destinations and linkages, computes its own least-haul-cost route for every block and destination, and
checks the sum against the reference's value for that block's node.

The comparison covers the C5-class sample: 36 722 segments, 27 231 vertices, three mills, 12 568 blocks,
which is 37 701 node-and-mill comparisons that a block is linked to.

## Definitions and tolerances, stated

- **Unreachable.** The reference writes `-1`; WS4 returns no route. The two are treated as the same
  answer, and a disagreement in either direction is a difference.
- **Numeric tolerance.** An absolute 1e-6 on the summed haul rate. Both sides sum the same `HAUL`
  column, so the only slack needed is floating-point order.
- **Nodes with no block.** Skipped. WS4 routes from blocks, so a node no block links to is not a
  comparison it can make; the reference reports every node in its vertices table.

## What it found

**No differences.** `python scripts/acceptance.py --roads-sample <sample>/roads` reports

```
parity      PASS  WS4 agrees with the reference on all 37701 routed node-and-mill pairs
```

including every node the reference marks unreachable that a block is linked to. That is a real result
for the routing claim: same network, same least-haul-cost definition, same sums.

## What it does not cover

Stated rather than implied, because the harness is the thing a reviewer will lean on:

- **Schedules and account values.** The sample ships no account report from the reference, so
  "the same schedule produces the same accounts in both tools" is *not* demonstrated here. That is the
  largest remaining gap in the replacement claim, and it needs reference outputs that do not exist in
  the sample.
- **Build and maintenance costs.** The reference ships haul costs per node only; the per-period build
  and maintenance accounts are compared by the WS4 suites, not against the reference.
- **The compiled matrix** is compared by the existing `--case` mechanism in the same tool, against a
  reference matrix directory. Both comparisons live in `scripts/acceptance.py`.

## How to run it

```bash
python scripts/acceptance.py --roads-sample /path/to/sample/roads
```

It prints one line per check and exits non-zero if the parity check finds a difference. Without
`--roads-sample` the check skips, so the tool still runs on a machine that has no reference sample.

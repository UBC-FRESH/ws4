# Change Log

Newest entries last. Each milestone gets a dated entry that matches the roadmap status and the GitHub
issue comments.

## 2026-10-14

- Adopted the UBC-FRESH dev workflow in WS4: added `AGENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGE_LOG.md`, and the
  `notes/` tree. Phase 0 (Scope and design) is active on `feature/p0-scope-design`.
- P0.2: wrote the problem statement and scope in `notes/design/ws4-scope.md`.
- P0.3: recorded six architecture decisions in `notes/adr/0001` to `notes/adr/0006`.
- P0.4: wrote the architecture design in `notes/design/ws4-architecture.md`.
- P0.6: neutralized third-party naming in the skeleton. Renamed `ws4/io/patchworks_xml.py` to
  `ws4/io/forest_model_xml.py`, and reworded the CLI help, README, and docstrings to describe an
  "XML recipe" and a "launch control file". A repository-wide check for the old vocabulary is clean.
- The workflow tooling (validator, dashboard, docs, tests, CI) is not installed yet; it is P0.5.
  Until then, the package checks in `pyproject.toml` apply.

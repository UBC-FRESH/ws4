# Change Log

Newest entries last. Each milestone gets a dated entry that matches the roadmap status and the GitHub
issue comments.

## 2026-10-14

- Adopted the UBC-FRESH dev workflow in WS4: added `AGENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGE_LOG.md`, and the
  `notes/` tree. Phase 0 (Scope and design) is active on `feature/p0-scope-design`.
- P0.2: wrote the problem statement and scope in `notes/design/ws4-scope.md`.
- P0.3: recorded six architecture decisions in `notes/adr/0001` to `notes/adr/0006`.
- P0.4: wrote the architecture design in `notes/design/ws4-architecture.md`.
- P0.6: neutralized third-party naming in the skeleton. Renamed `ws4/io/patchworks_xml.py` to
  `ws4/io/forest_model_xml.py`, and reworded the CLI help, README, and docstrings to describe an
  "XML recipe" and a "launch control file". A repository-wide check for the old vocabulary is clean.
- P0.5: installed the UBC-FRESH dev workflow tooling. Added `scripts/check_workflow.py` and
  `scripts/dashboard.py`, the docs skeleton, the framework tests, the CI workflows, the issue
  templates, `requirements-dev.txt`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and the recommended `LICENSE`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `CITATION.cff`. Merged the tool configuration into `pyproject.toml` and
  fixed the skeleton to pass lint, format, and types.
  Dashboard result: `python scripts/dashboard.py` reports `OVERALL: GREEN` on all six gates (lint,
  format, types, tests, validator, docs).
- Opened the Phase 0 parent issue #1 and child issues #2 to #7. Closed the child issues with closeout
  comments, and set the phase to `pr-open`.
- P0.7: recorded the optimization and execution architecture in
  `notes/design/ws4-optimization-stack.md`, with ADR 0007 (layered, pluggable optimization stack),
  ADR 0008 (Python first, C++ kernels behind a stable API), ADR 0009 (parallel and GPU execution), and
  ADR 0010 (telemetry-driven tuning and the meta-meta-heuristic portfolio). Updated the scope and the
  architecture note, and added the P2 build tasks for the solver core, the execution substrate, and the
  math-heuristic layer.
- Queued the Phase 0 close-out: pull request #8 (`feature/p0-scope-design` into `main`) and the report
  `notes/reports/p0-closeout.md`. Status: awaiting maintainer approval.
- Completed Phase 0: squash-merged pull request #8 as `386c643`, deleted `feature/p0-scope-design`, and
  closed parent issue #1.
- Launched Phase 1 (Contracts and prototype) on `feature/p1-contracts-prototype`, parent issue #10, with
  tasks P1.1 (compiled-dataset schema and manifest) and P1.2 (end-to-end prototype).
- P1.1: defined the compiled-dataset schema and manifest. Added `ws4/model/schema.py` (tables, manifest,
  validator), `docs/reference/compiled-dataset.rst`, a `ws4 validate` implementation, `tests/test_schema.py`,
  and the package `__init__.py` files plus the `ws4.build.compiler` stub. Added `pandas-stubs` to the dev
  requirements. Dashboard result: `python scripts/dashboard.py` reports `OVERALL: GREEN`.
- P1.2: built the end-to-end prototype. Added `examples/synthetic/` (recipe, fragments, notes), a real
  `ws4 build` compiler that writes the matrix and manifest, a real `ws4 simulate` that replays a schedule
  and writes `account_values.csv`, `ws4/sim/curve.py`, and `tests/test_prototype.py` (build, validate,
  grow, and treat). Dashboard result: `python scripts/dashboard.py` reports `OVERALL: GREEN`.
- P1.3: adopted the established ForestModelXML recipe format and recorded the matrix builder and legacy
  dataset ingestion in `notes/design/ws4-matrix-builder-and-interop.md`, with ADR 0011 (adopt the format
  and support legacy datasets) and ADR 0012 (two construction paths: file-based and programmatic). Updated
  the scope, the architecture note, and the P2 tasks.
- Queued the Phase 1 close-out: pull request #14 (`feature/p1-contracts-prototype` into `main`) and the
  report `notes/reports/p1-closeout.md`. Status: awaiting maintainer approval.
- P1 fix: the CI jobs now install the package (`python -m pip install -e .`) before the gates, because
  mypy and pytest need the runtime dependencies (pydantic, pandas, numpy, pyarrow). Added
  `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` so the package builds. The pre-commit parity job is green again.
- P1 fix: the `.gitignore` rule `build/` also ignored the `ws4/build/` package, so the compiler was
  never committed. Narrowed the rule to `/build/` and committed `ws4/build/__init__.py` and
  `ws4/build/compiler.py`. This is why CI could not resolve `ws4.build.compiler`.

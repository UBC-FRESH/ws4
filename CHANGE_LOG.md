## 2026-10-14

- Adopted the UBC-FRESH dev workflow in WS4: added `AGENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGE_LOG.md`, and the
  `notes/` tree. Phase 0 (Scope and design) is active on `feature/p0-scope-design`.
- P0.2: wrote the problem statement and scope in `notes/design/ws4-scope.md`.
- P0.3: recorded six architecture decisions in `notes/adr/0001` to `notes/adr/0006`.
- P0.4: wrote the architecture design in `notes/design/ws4-architecture.md`.
- P0.6: neutralized third-party naming in the skeleton. Renamed `ws4/io/patchworks_xml.py` to
  `ws4/io/forest_model_xml.py`, and reworded the CLI help, README, and docstrings to describe an
  "XML recipe" and a "launch control file". A repository-wide check for the old vocabulary is clean.
- P0.5: installed the UBC-FRESH dev workflow tooling. Added `scripts/check_workflow.py` and
  `scripts/dashboard.py`, the docs skeleton, the framework tests, the CI workflows, the issue
  templates, `requirements-dev.txt`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and the recommended `LICENSE`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `CITATION.cff`. Merged the tool configuration into `pyproject.toml` and
  fixed the skeleton to pass lint, format, and types.
  Dashboard result: `python scripts/dashboard.py` reports `OVERALL: GREEN` on all six gates (lint,
  format, types, tests, validator, docs).
- Opened the Phase 0 parent issue #1 and child issues #2 to #7. Closed the child issues with closeout
  comments, and set the phase to `pr-open`.
- P0.7: recorded the optimization and execution architecture in
  `notes/design/ws4-optimization-stack.md`, with ADR 0007 (layered, pluggable optimization stack),
  ADR 0008 (Python first, C++ kernels behind a stable API), ADR 0009 (parallel and GPU execution), and
  ADR 0010 (telemetry-driven tuning and the meta-meta-heuristic portfolio). Updated the scope and the
  architecture note, and added the P2 build tasks for the solver core, the execution substrate, and the
  math-heuristic layer.
- Queued the Phase 0 close-out: pull request #8 (`feature/p0-scope-design` into `main`) and the report
  `notes/reports/p0-closeout.md`. Status: awaiting maintainer approval.
- Completed Phase 0: squash-merged pull request #8 as `386c643`, deleted `feature/p0-scope-design`, and
  closed parent issue #1.
- Launched Phase 1 (Contracts and prototype) on `feature/p1-contracts-prototype`, parent issue #10, with
  tasks P1.1 (compiled-dataset schema and manifest) and P1.2 (end-to-end prototype).
- P1.1: defined the compiled-dataset schema and manifest. Added `ws4/model/schema.py` (tables, manifest,
  validator), `docs/reference/compiled-dataset.rst`, a `ws4 validate` implementation, `tests/test_schema.py`,
  and the package `__init__.py` files plus the `ws4.build.compiler` stub. Added `pandas-stubs` to the dev
  requirements. Dashboard result: `python scripts/dashboard.py` reports `OVERALL: GREEN`.
- P1.2: built the end-to-end prototype. Added `examples/synthetic/` (recipe, fragments, notes), a real
  `ws4 build` compiler that writes the matrix and manifest, a real `ws4 simulate` that replays a schedule
  and writes `account_values.csv`, `ws4/sim/curve.py`, and `tests/test_prototype.py` (build, validate,
  grow, and treat). Dashboard result: `python scripts/dashboard.py` reports `OVERALL: GREEN`.
- P1.3: adopted the established ForestModelXML recipe format and recorded the matrix builder and legacy
  dataset ingestion in `notes/design/ws4-matrix-builder-and-interop.md`, with ADR 0011 (adopt the format
  and support legacy datasets) and ADR 0012 (two construction paths: file-based and programmatic). Updated
  the scope, the architecture note, and the P2 tasks.
- Queued the Phase 1 close-out: pull request #14 (`feature/p1-contracts-prototype` into `main`) and the
  report `notes/reports/p1-closeout.md`. Status: awaiting maintainer approval.
- P1 fix: the CI jobs now install the package (`python -m pip install -e .`) before the gates, because
  mypy and pytest need the runtime dependencies (pydantic, pandas, numpy, pyarrow). Added
  `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` so the package builds. The pre-commit parity job is green again.
- P1 fix: the `.gitignore` rule `build/` also ignored the `ws4/build/` package, so the compiler was
  never committed. Narrowed the rule to `/build/` and committed `ws4/build/__init__.py` and
  `ws4/build/compiler.py`. This is why CI could not resolve `ws4.build.compiler`.
- Completed Phase 1: squash-merged pull request #14 as `33ac569`, deleted `feature/p1-contracts-prototype`,
  and closed parent issue #10.
- Launched Phase 2 (Build) on `feature/p2-build`, parent issue #15, with tasks P2.1 to P2.9 (#16 to #24).
- P2.1 (in progress): replaced the prototype's minimal recipe parser with a ForestModelXML parser and
  matrix builder, and added legacy matrix ingestion. The parser handles the real MKRf recipe
  (`baseMKRF.xml`: 1057 curves, 11 selects, CC and CT treatments, 14 features, 14 products) and the
  select statement operators `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`, `in`, with opaque terms for function
  calls. Added `ws4 ingest`, `tests/test_forest_model_xml.py`, and `tests/test_legacy.py`, and a
  `docs/reference/forestmodelxml.rst` page that records the known gaps (full expression evaluation,
  expression-sourced curves, `%`-token labels, succession/retention, shapefile input). Dashboard result:
  `python scripts/dashboard.py` reports `OVERALL: GREEN`.
- Recorded the Model II formulation in `notes/design/ws4-matrix-builder-and-interop.md` (section 4) and
  `docs/reference/forestmodelxml.rst`: state variables define a stratum, a track is a unique trajectory
  over time between two treatments, and a treatment resets state variables, which switches the block to
  the target stratum's track. This is the expansion engine the matrix builder needs, and it explains the
  reference matrix's 7048 tracks and its per-portion block rows.
- P2.1: implemented the Model II expansion engine (`ws4/build/expansion.py`). The builder now enumerates
  the reachable strata (inventory plus treatment transitions, to a fixed point), expands each stratum
  into a track, treats a stratum as governed by every matching select (so features, products, and
  treatments accumulate), and emits one block row per portion. On the reference recipe and fragments this
  yields 1399 strata and 2024 treatment rows (from 0). Added `tests/test_expansion.py`. Dashboard result:
  `python scripts/dashboard.py` reports `OVERALL: GREEN`.
- P2.1: completed the Model II expansion against a reference matrix. Added field-reference and
  concatenation transition resolution (`au = auf`, `'thn_'+au`) and `<retention>` splits (the retained
  fraction moves to the assigned state). Against a real 218-fragment instance, the builder now matches
  the reference exactly on tracks (351), strata (351), treatments (263), and blocks (399).
- P2.1: canonicalized numeric state values (an integral float renders without a decimal part) so a
  numeric column matches an integer literal in a select. With that fix, the builder matches every tested
  reference matrix exactly: the k3z intensive variants (732/732/963/427 and 553/553/605/427) and a
  421,945-fragment instance (tsa29: tracks 524, strata 524, treatments 210). Added the backlog note
  `notes/backlog.md` as the consolidated gap list.
- P2.1: added a bounded select-expression evaluator (`ws4/io/expressions.py`): comparisons, booleans,
  parentheses, and the functions `startswith`, `endswith`, `substring`, `int`, `Number`, `length`, and
  `if`, with a fallback to the term matcher. The k3z reference matrices still match exactly, and the
  MKRf PoC CT eligibility now evaluates (`not startswith(au,'t')`).
- P2.1: the builder now matches the k3z reference exactly on **features and products** as well. A select
  with a `treatment eq 'X'` context contributes products tagged `X` to the stratum matching its other
  terms (it is not a stratum dimension), and accounts are the union of feature and product labels grouped
  by management state. Accounts are close but not exact (k3z pct_light 1507 vs 1460; the reference
  excludes zero-signal families, recorded in the backlog).
- P2.2: implemented the annual simulator over the compiled contract. A scheduled treatment applies only
  where the fragment's track offers it (the Model II operability rule) and moves the fragment to its
  `new_track`. Applying a treatment records its product yield (area times the product curve at the
  pre-treatment offset) to `product_values.csv`. Added `tests/test_simulator.py` (deterministic replay;
  an unoffered treatment is a no-op; a treatment records its product yield).
- P2.2: implemented patch metrics over the block topology (`ws4/patch/metrics.py`): connected patches,
  size classes, and mean size. The simulator writes `patch_metrics.csv` when given a topology. Added
  `tests/test_patch.py` and a simulator patch-metric test.
- P2.3: implemented the weighted-goal objective (`ws4/opt/objective.py`, targets from YAML), a
  neighbourhood-operator registry (`ws4/opt/operators.py`: toggle, shift, swap), and a seeded
  simulated-annealing optimizer (`ws4/opt/engine.py`) that evaluates candidates through the simulator.
  Added `tests/test_optimizer.py`; `pyyaml` and `types-PyYAML` added to the dependencies.
- P2.3: extracted three metaheuristics into `ws4/opt/solvers.py` — simulated annealing, tabu search, and
  iterated local search — selected by `OptimizeConfig.metaheuristic` over the same operator registry and
  objective. `tests/test_optimizer.py` runs all three and checks each lowers the penalty.
- P2.4: added multi-start to the optimizer (`OptimizeConfig.starts`); each start uses its own seed and the
  best incumbent wins. A test asserts more starts is no worse than fewer.
- P2.7: implemented the road network subsystem (`ws4/roads/network.py`): load the four tables, build the
  segment graph, and route by shortest length or cost, with nearest-destination lookup. Added
  `tests/test_roads.py`.
- P2.7: routed the simulator's product flows. When given a road network, the simulator sends each
  produced product to the block's single nearest destination (exclusive by construction) and writes
  `route_values.csv` (volume, route length, and cost). Added a routing test.
- P2.9: implemented the programmatic model API (`ws4/model/api.py`). A `Model` holds one DataFrame per
  matrix table, with `append` and `replace`; `from_dataset` loads and `write` saves, round-tripping a
  dataset. Added `tests/test_model_api.py`.
- P2.4: defined the solver-core boundary (`ws4/opt/core.py`: a `Problem` adapter with an evaluator,
  candidate moves, and an operator registry) and refactored the solvers to take it. Added run telemetry
  (`ws4/opt/telemetry.py`: a JSONL header and one step record per iteration); the optimizer writes
  `telemetry.jsonl`. Added telemetry tests.
- P2.5: added parallel multi-start (`OptimizeConfig.workers`). Starts run across a process pool, one
  seeded start per worker, and the best incumbent wins; the serial path is unchanged. Added a parallel
  test.
- P2.6: added the destroy-repair large-neighbourhood operator (`lns`, in the default registry) and warm
  starts (`OptimizeConfig.warm_start` seeds the search from each block's first candidate). Added tests.
- Synced the UBC-FRESH dev workflow tooling to its latest release (P1-P4): updated
  `scripts/check_workflow.py` and the CI action versions and runners (`ubuntu-24.04`, `checkout@v5`,
  `setup-python@v6`, `upload-artifact@v6`, and the Pages actions), keeping the package install step.
- P2.8: implemented accounts and reporting (`ws4/report.py`): an account summary, a ratio account, and a
  target-status table; `ws4 report` is a CLI command, and the optimizer writes a report at the end of a
  run. Added `tests/test_report.py`.
